# Comments are allowed in these test files as long as the first character of a line is '#'
# Commands are ordered in the form of PID, Instruction, Address, Value
# PID can be anything non-zero, the address can be up to 255, value can be up to 255
# Here's a table of commands:
#
# 1 - MAP - gives gives PID a new page that is writable if Value is 1. Ignores address
# 2 - STR - stores Value in Address in PID's address space.
# 3 - LDM - load PID's memory at Address. Ignores value
# 4 - DMP - dump the contents of the page table in binary form to STDOUT. Used for debugging
#
# First, let's give PID 1 two pages (1 writable) and a third writable one to PID 2
1,1,0,1
1,1,0,0
2,1,0,1
# Try to write to page 1 of PID 1, then read from it
1,2,13,42
1,3,13,0
# That should've worked. Now try writing to PID 1's second page, but get its original content first
1,3,17,0
1,2,17,47
# That above command should've failed
1,3,17,0
# This one should have returned 0, just like the original load
#
